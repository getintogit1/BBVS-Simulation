# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based Voting System Simulation

A Python-based simulation of a secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting system using **commutative asymmetric encryption** and a **blockchain-like ledger**. This system enables voters to **cast anonymized votes**, **verify their own votes**, and **tally the results** in a transparent yet private way.

> 🔐 Inspired by the **SRA Mental Poker** protocol and the **Ossey-Mura Cryptosystem**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Anonymous Voting** – Cast encrypted votes while preserving voter privacy.
- 🔐 **Commutative Asymmetric Encryption** – Enables encryption/decryption in any order without compromising results.
- 🔎 **Vote Verification** – Each voter can verify that their vote is included in the ledger.
- 📊 **Secure Vote Counting** – Votes are decrypted and tallied securely.
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Simulation** – Each vote is a block in a linked chain to ensure transparency and immutability.
